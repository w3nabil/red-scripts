## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to improve the security of Red-Scripts by reporting a vulnerability. We appreciate your effort and are committed to addressing any security concerns promptly.

### About Red-Scripts

Red-Scripts is designed to check the vulnerability of any system, server, or script. It does not store any data online; all data is saved locally on the user’s PC. This ensures user privacy and security while using the tool.

### How to Report

If you discover a vulnerability in Red-Scripts, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**
   - To protect our users, please avoid sharing details of the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved.

2. **Contact Us Directly**
   - Email your findings to: [w3nabil@gmail.com](mailto:w3nabil@gmail.com)
   - Use the subject line: `Security Vulnerability Report: [Brief Description]`

3. **Provide Detailed Information**
   Include the following details in your report:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability.

### What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment**
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

2. **Investigation**
   - Our security team will investigate the issue and may reach out to you for further details.

3. **Resolution**
   - We aim to address all vulnerabilities promptly, typically within 90 days of initial disclosure, depending on complexity.

4. **Public Disclosure**
   - Once resolved, we will coordinate with you to disclose the vulnerability responsibly. If applicable, we will credit you for your discovery.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or disruption of services.
